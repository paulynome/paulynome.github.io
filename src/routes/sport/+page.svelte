    I spent several years at the Conservatoire de Musique de Sète learning violin and viola, as well as basic music theory. Playing in an orchestra was an enriching experience.
    
    During my years in classe préparatoire, I got into running. This allowed me to discover the city of Toulouse. I did the Toulouse marathon in early November.
    
    At ENSEEIHT, I started to create video games. Creating video games need technical but also artistic skills and creativity.

    I also joined <a href="https://net7.dev/" class="underline">Net7</a>, the school computer association where I did my first CTF.

    I'm participating to <a href="https://prologin.org/" class="underline">Prologin</a> a national computer science competition.
